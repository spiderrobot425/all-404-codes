# 🫖 Teapot Code Redirector

Welcome to the weirdest HTTP status code experience on the internet.

This is a static site that lists **real, rare, and totally made-up HTTP status codes** — and every single one of them redirects you to the legendary [google.com/teapot](https://google.com/teapot).

| 123456   | Critical Glitch 👾                      | ❌ Fake |

...and many more.

## 🧪 How It Works

- A grid of buttons is generated from a list of codes.
- Each button has a tooltip that describes the code.
- Clicking any button takes you to:  
  **`https://google.com/teapot`**

No server, no backend — just static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
